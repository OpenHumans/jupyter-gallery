# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in wanting to contribute to this repository!

If you haven't already, come [find me on Slack](http://slackin.openhumans.org/), I'm @gedankenstuecke there. 

## Testing

So far there aren't any tests for this app, but [there is a set of proposed tests](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/jupyter-gallery/issues/12) if you're a fan of writing tests!

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/jupyter-gallery/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow the coding conventions (below).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

This repository tries (and fails) to adhere to the Python style guide. If you want to contribute please try to do the same. HoundCI is set up to check for the style and will complain otherwise. For local verification you can run [flake8](flake8.pycqa.org/)

  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
Carl Tashian, Participatory Politics Foundation
